# Quality Control System for Glue Dots on Printed Circuit Boards

This python project was done at the Santa Cruz Institut for Particle Physics, within the ATLAS group. It's purpose is to assess the 
quality of glue dots on printed circuit boards used within the production line of the Strip Detector Modules for the Inner Tracker at LHC. It's corresponding thesis can be found [here](https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/9XAGtdkjyritYbF) (It's a high res version, therefor it is quite large. ). 

It's written in python and utilizes OpenCV as well as some machine learning methods from the scikit-learn module.
